{{Quote
| quote  = [[Pathfinder]] [[Lugizar Trantos]] recently returned from the [[Mwangi Expanse]] with haunted eyes and a pack full of strange idols. [[Absalom|Absalom's]] famed [[Blakros Museum]] purchased his pieces and Lugizar vanished. The strange monkey idols he pulled from the misty jungles of Mwangi carry with them a fell curse, and now their power has laid claim to the museum. Can the [[Pathfinder Society]] uncover the source of the curse in time, or will the Blakros Museum be forever lost to the mists of Mwangi?
