{{Quote
| quote  = Thousands of years ago, a defeated order of [[Osirion|Osirian]] sages sought refuge in the perilous Pillars of the Sun in central Osirion. Until recently they were presumed lost, but recent exploration has uncovered the fortress sanctum they left behind. When the PCs delve into one of its sealed halls, they find the sages' millennia-old projects dormant but not dead.}}
