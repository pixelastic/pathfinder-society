{{Quote
| quote  = The [[Pathfinder Society]] seeks the ancient ruby ring of the salamander and it falls to a team of [[Pathfinder]]s to find it. Last seen in the [[Tri-Towers Yard]], a once elite academy for the youth of [[Absalom]], the ruby ring is now lost in the [[Drownyard]], all that remains of Tri-Towers after it was destroyed a decade ago in the great quake. The Pathfinders must risk the strange black ichors and salty brine to find their prizeâ€”will they risk their very souls as well?
