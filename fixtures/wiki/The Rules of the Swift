{{Quote
| header = 
| quote  = In the conclusion of the [[The Devil We Know|Devil We Know]] campaign arc, you are called once more to [[Cassomir]], where a mass abduction of the residents of [[Swift Prison]] has the entire town in a panic. [[Venture-Captain]] [[Hestia Themis]] once more partners you with an [[Aspis Consortium|Aspis]] agent to see what link the Swift Prison event has to the earlier kidnapping of a [[Pathfinder]] agent. You will explore an empty prison, delve the tunnels below, and come face-to-face with the source of Cassomir's troubles in a vile grotto deep beneath the city.
