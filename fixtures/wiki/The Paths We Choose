'''''The Paths We Choose''''', a [[Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild|Pathfinder Society]] Special written by [[Tim Hitchcock]] for tier 3-7, was released at [[Gen Con]] 2014 in August 2014. It marks the first scenario of the [[Year of the Sky Key]] and the final scenario for the [[Andoran (faction)|Andoran]], [[Cheliax (faction)|Cheliax]], [[Osirion (faction)|Osirion]], [[Qadira (faction)|Qadira]], [[Sczarni (faction)|Sczarni]], and [[Taldor (faction)|Taldor]] factions.

{{Quote
| quote  = The failure of [[Mendev]]'s [[wardstones]] set in motion not only a new crusade but also catalyzed a change in the [[Pathfinder Society]]'s various factions. As the Pathfinders prepare to march on the Sky Citadel [[Jormurdun]], members of the various factions scramble to consolidate their gains and neutralize their enemies. 

"The Paths We Choose" is a special event designed to highlight the changes in each faction over the course of Season 5, [[Year of the Demon]], and the adventure is different for each group depending on which factions are represented at the table. Content in "The Paths We Choose" also contributes directly to the ongoing storylines of the Andoran, Cheliax, Osirion, Qadira, Sczarni, and Taldor factions. This adventure kicks off Season 6, [[Year of the Sky Key]] and is for character levels 3-7.
