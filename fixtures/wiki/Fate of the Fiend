{{Quote
| Years after the Pathfinder Society delved deep into the Jistkan ruins of [[Rachikan]] in western Cheliax, archaeological investigations continue to uncover ancient wonder. Reports recently ceased after scholars reported finding a sealed chamber believed to contain cadres of battle golems untouched since the Jistka Imperium's collapse. The Pathfinder Society hopes to recover the golems for study and possible use in  [[The Worldwound]], but can its agents reach the sealed storeroom before the constructs fall into enemy hands?}}
