{{Quote
| quote  = [[4708 AR|Several years ago]], a [[Taldor|Taldan]] [[Zyphus]] cult took over a famous [[Oppara]] opera house, murdered a [[Pathfinder]], and turned dozens of Taldor's wealthiest citizens into the walking dead. The [[Pathfinder Society]] has finally tracked down their hideout and sends you to Oppara for one purpose: revenge. Can you face the servants of [[Golarion|Golarion's]] god of accidents unharmed or will you find yourself among Zyphus's cursed souls?

''Among the Dead'' is a follow-up scenario to ''[[Among the Living|Pathfinder Society Scenario #7: Among the Living]]''. When played together, the scenarios create a mini story arc in Taldor's gilded capital, Oppara.}}
