{{Quote
| quote  = A parasitic faction known as the [[Korholm Agenda]] has tried to corrupt the upstanding [[Aspis Consortium]] from the inside out, all in the vain pursuit of revenge and profit. Now one of the powerful [[Patrons|Aspis Patrons]] has learned that the Korholm Agenda has siphoned the Consortium's funding to build a base of operations in [[Nidal]]. This shall not stand. He has assembled a team of top agents&mdash;including both new faces and veterans of the attack on the [[Grand Lodge]] [[4715 AR|a year ago]]&mdash;to infiltrate the operation and shut it down by any means necessary.

In this adventure the players portray agents of the Aspis Consortium using 8th-level pregenerated characters. Content in "Serpents' Ire" also ties into a special metaplot element from [[Serpents Rise|Pathfinder Society Special #6â€“98: "Serpents Rise."]] Players who have completed that special event are encouraged to bring its Chronicle sheet when playing this adventure.
