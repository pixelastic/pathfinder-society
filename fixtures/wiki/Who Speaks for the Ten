| quote  = The [[Tar-Baphon|Whispering Tyrant]] has arisen, and war once again looms at [[Absalom]]'s doorstep. Yet with most [[Pathfinder]]s far to the north neutralizing the Tyrant's [[Radiant Fire|secret weapon]], the [[Grand Lodge]] is understaffed and vulnerable. Now that the PCs have identified the threat [[Grandmaster Torch]] poses, they are among the few capable of entering the Grand Lodge's most restricted reaches, averting disaster, and changing the face of the [[Pathfinder Society]] forever.

"Who Speaks for the Ten" is the second and final seeker-level adventure in the "Passing the Torch" series that concludes Season 10, and these adventures take place in parallel with the events of Pathfinder Society Special #10-98: [[Siege of Gallowspire]]. This adventure is preceded by Pathfinder Society Scenario #10-22: Passing the Torch, Part 1: [[Who Wears the Mask]]. These two scenarios are intended to be played in order.
