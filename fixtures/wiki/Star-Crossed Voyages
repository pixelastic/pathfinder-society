| quote  = The [[Pathfinder Society]] is called upon to aid the fledgling nation of [[Vidrian]]! As the PCs sail beyond the edge of the [[Inner Sea]] and into the waters off the coast of southern [[Garund]] searching for new trade routes to connect Vidrian with new allies, the PCs find themselves amongst the [[iruxi]], a civilization of lizardfolk [[astrologist]]s. While the iruxi themselves seem to be likely allies, other forces stir in the nearby jungles, and if the PCs hope to return north with news of a newly charted route, they will need to first face an ancient evil whose presence complicates navigating the treacherous ocean ways.
