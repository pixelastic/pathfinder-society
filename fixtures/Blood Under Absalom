{{Quote
| quote  = The [[Ruby Phoenix Tournament]] is nigh, and organizations and individuals throughout the [[Inner Sea]] are scrambling to secure a spot in the legendary [[Tian Xia|Tian]] fighting competition, among them the [[Pathfinder Society]]. In an underground qualifier event overseen by an enigmatic old [[monk]] and his [[oni]] spokesman, the Pathfinders must overcome the opposition to ensure the Society can send representatives to distant [[Goka]] to compete in the Ruby Phoenix Tournament itself. Battles will rage and blood will flow under the streets of [[Absalom]], and only the greatest combatants will emerge victorious.
